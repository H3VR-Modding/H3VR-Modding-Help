# Manual Installation

This guide assumes you are a very stubborn, very stuck in their ways person. We all hate you. It also assumes you know the different [mod types](Mod-Types.md). It also assumes you are using Deli 0.3.2 and are missing out on all of the cool new things. (And also assumes you know how to install most dependencies).

## From Bonetome

All Bonetome mods come zipped or packaged as a `.rar` file. Inside these you will either find a folder, or the specific file for you to install.

- Deli
  - Files should be extracted to the `H3VR/Deli/mods/` folder.
- Sideloader
  - Files should be extracted to the `H3VR/mods/` folder.
- Assetbundles
  - Files should be extracted to the `H3VR/Deli/mods/legacy/LegacyVirtualObjects/` folder.

## From Thunderstore

Thunderstore mods are zipped similarly, and are installed the same. Keep in mind that BepInEx plugins are present. These have a singular `.dll` file and are placed into the `H3VR/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
