# Getting Started

## Bonetome and Thunderstore

[**Bonetome**](https://bonetome.com/h3vr/) and [**Thunderstore**](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io) are the two main sites to get mods from. Currently, you want to use Thunderstore first as Bonetome is being phased out.

Bonetome is old, and still has old installation instructions on the mod page. Please ignore these. It does however have a larger mod database, all compatible with the new installation method.

Thunderstore is the current standard of installing mods, and is meant to be used with the mod manager [**r2modman**](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). It is ***highly*** recommended to use this when installing mods.

The rest of this document assumes you have r2modman installed, please go to the [Manual Installation](Manual-Installation.md) section of this document.
