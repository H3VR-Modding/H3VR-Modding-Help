# MeatKit build settings
In MeatKit, there is a file which stores your build settings. The majority of these settings and the ones we'll go over now relate to the metadata of your Thunderstore package, like name, description, icon, etc., but there are some more we will get into later.

In this second article of the MeatKit getting started guide, you will configure your build settings to make your mod appear as your own.

## Accessing the build settings
To access the build settings, from the toolbar at the top of Unity select `MeatKit > Build > Configure`. This will select the build settings file and show it in the Unity inspector window.
