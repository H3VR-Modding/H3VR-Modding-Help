# Creating A Mod
Congratulations, you now know the basics of MeatKit and can start making your own mod!

Currently mod support for MeatKit is limited to Atlas scenes. There will be more available in the future, but for now you can check out the [Atlas section of the wiki](../../mapping/atlas/intro.md).
