title: Manual Installation
---

Manual installation is not recommended **AT ALL**. There is no reason for you to be doing so. Please use [r2modman](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Thunderstore Mod manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager).

Reading past this point you agree to not receive help from those willing to give it.

This guide assumes you know how to read the dependencies of each mod and install them yourself, also what [Mod Types](mod_types.md) are which.

## Manual placement

Installing mods requires certain mods to create their folders beforehand, if you fail to comply your mods will most likely be wiped from existence.

### Deli Mods

Deli mods require to placed inside of the `BepInEx/plugins/[a folder you need to make]/`

### Sideloader mods

Sideloader mods require them to be placed inside of the `BepInEx/Sideloader/` folder.

### Asset bundles

Asset bundles require to be placed inside of the `BepInEx/plugins/[a folder you need to make]/LegacyVirtualObjects/` folder.

If you would like to avoid using profiles, you can place them into `H3VR/LegacyVirtualObjects/`.
