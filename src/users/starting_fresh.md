To preform a clean installation of H3VR, please follow the following steps:

1. Delete all files in your main H3VR directory except for the `h3vr_data/` folder. This process will remove any mod related items, and leave the large parts of H3VR untouched so you don't have to redownload gigabytes of data. Keep in mind, your Vault files are stored in another folder and will not be touched.

2. Open steam, and navigate to the game's properties by right-clicking on the game in the list.

3. Click on the `Local Files` menu on the left of the properties window, then press verify steam files.

4. Steam will now download the missing files it needs to run H3VR. A clean installation will be left after it does so.
